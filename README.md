# Build Infrastructure Using Terraform

Terraform Cloud:-
Terraform Cloud enables infrastructure automation for provisioning, compliance, and management of any cloud, datacenter, and service.

Write configuration:-
The set of files used to describe infrastructure in Terraform is known as a Terraform configuration. You will write your first configuration to define a single AWS EC2 instance.
Each Terraform configuration must be in its own working directory. Create a directory for your configuration.
